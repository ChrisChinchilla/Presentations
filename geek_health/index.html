						I have been specific here as I personally don't think Geek is the same as developer and vice-versa. But it get's the attention :)

						Preface with saying that I by no means the healthiest, fittest person there. Not at all. But I want to make sure that our community is as healthy as it can be as easily as possible.

						I also think the German community is far better than others.

						This is not unique to tech, everyone is sitting down way too much. This has been reported in many outlets. Though I find less people here concerned about it here strangely.

						The studies showed sedentary behavior can lead to death from cardiovascular issues and cancer as well as cause chronic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes.

						Physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth-leading risk factor for death for people all around the world, according to the World Health Organization.

						Prolonged sitting, meaning sitting for eight to 12 hours or more a day, increased your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 90%.

						And just because we know something is bad for use, doesn't mean we stop doing it.

						This is not a new issue and is one that many are aware of, however many still think of it as strange if you want to move around or stand, especially at events.

						There are mixed options on how much energy the brain uses, it does demand up to 20% of our bodies energy.

						But it is unproven quite how much difference thinking hard and sustained intellectual activity makes above and beyond the typical energy consumption.

						Most seem to agree that long periods of mental activity can have an impact on your levels of energy, this may be more from the strain of focus or frustration more than anything else, because sometimes intellectual activity can also be inspiring and awakening.

						Technology is amazing, we can accomplish many things with it, but it has also helped us shut out the world around us and get stuck in a filter bubble of people all around the world who share our own opinions. This has been a positive for many of us who have always been slightly more socially awkward, but has reduced our connection to the world directly around us.

						As a developer we often work long hours and long periods of mental strain, this is tiring, so we look to caffeine and other substances to keep us awake.
