# What IKEA and game manuals taught me about technical writing
_Write the Docs 2016_

## What now?

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./chipshop.jpg" -->

Note: Paul and I are competing for titles. Explain what Chip Shop is, the process, why etc. Explain where I come from, and how it all relates. Looking at how game manuals were written helped me understand my own tech writing better. I want to talk to some designers of instructional manuals but haven't yet, I have spoken to games writers though.

## â€¦Oh, and I moved cities

<!-- .slide: data-background="./instructions_IKEA_billy.jpg" -->

Note: So of course, I spent a lot of time looking at these. Personally I think they are surprisingly good.

---

## Who?

> You can take this action

Note: An extracted example, from I think, Cosmic Encounter, an older game. What does 'you' mean? You, your ally? Some of this is due to English, in German this would be clear

---

## What?

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./ikea_clarity.png" -->

Note: I think these are great. Everything is included, you don't need to know what they're called. And you can even measure in the manual. This is harder with technical writing, but interactive consoles, and examples would be similar.

---

## Humans

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./play_test.jpg" -->

Note: As technical writers we have amazing tools for testing our writing, but our audience is still humans, and they have a tendancy to do things we don't expect, or try to 'break' what you've built.

---

## Iconography

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./7wonders_icons.png" -->

Note: This is an extreme example, but I like the idea of recognisable icons instead of lots of text. This is hard to get right, especially if you have unique concepts, but if you get it right it can also help reducing the need for translations.

---

## In the right order

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./ikea_whoops.jpg" -->

Note: We spend a lot of time thinking about onboarding and getting people to follow our steps in teh right order. But of course due to search and over zealous developers, this may not always be the case. How do we encourage developers to follow the 'right' steps without forcing them into things and annoying them?

---

## Inclusive

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./accessible.png" -->

Note: Whilst some criticise IKEA manuals, to me someone has spent a lot of time trying to make these clear in most languages and cultures. No words, nothing culturally exclusive.

---

## Make it enjoyable

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./grizzled.png" -->

Note: This game is about war in WW1 trenches, but still, it handles it in a balanced and as fun as possible kind of way.

---

## Make it enjoyable

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./ikea_fun.png" -->

Note: You may recognise this gender non-specific character too. But what does this mean to us? it's a balancing act, many use the Mail Chimp docs as exaple of fun, sometimes I find that actually a bit patronising and it's a fine line to walk.

## Thank You!
