## Shipping Containers - A Deep-Dive into the Docker Ecosystem

You've heard of Docker right? If you've been to any conferences over the past 18 months, attended any meetups or read any tech blogs I'm sure you've heard of containers and why they're awesome/scary/pointless/nothing new.

In this presentation I will move beyond basic Docker setup and usage and dig into what else you can do with Docker, what comprises the Docker ecosystem, and how everything fits together for a semi-cohesive and useful experience.

I will cover :

- Docker Machine, Swarm and Compose for easily creating clusters of Docker containers in multiple locations.
- The Docker Trusted Registry and Data Center for enterprise uses who need  a bit more control.
- Container management and orchestration tools such as Mesos, Kubernetes and The Docker Cloud.
- Need somewhere to host your containers in production? What are the best hosting options?

I will then wrap up by looking at what's coming soon and next for Docker.

## A Summary and Assessment of Docker Hosting and Management Options

As part of my journey with Docker, I have discovered and assessed many options for hosting, management and scaling Docker containers. I have dug beneath their collective surfaces, taken them for a test drive, pushed them to the edge, broken them, asked their staff a lot of questions and built up a good idea of which ones are worth spending your time (and maybe money) on.

In this presentation I will take a sample Docker application stack and demonstrate how Docker hosting solutions help (or hinder) the process. This will include Docker Cloud, AWS, Azure, Code Ship, Container Ship and several others.

I will cover:

- Using images from the Docker Hub and custom images
- Hosting options and portability of containers
- How Docker configuration options such as ports, entry points and commands are exposed
- Scaling containers
- Integration with Docker Toolset
- GUI and CLI options
- API availability
