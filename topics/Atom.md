# A hackers guide to the Atom editor

Atom is the text editor from GitHub, and the first application to use the Electron framework for creating native apps in JavaScript. Thanks to its underpinnings, customising the editor & extending functionality is something that anyone with basic coding skills can accomplish, and I'll show you how.

In this presentation I will show how to change and extend Atom with:

-   Changing configuration files
-   Install and create themes
-   Installing and customising packages
-   Creating your own packages
-   Debugging Atomâ€¦ With Atom
