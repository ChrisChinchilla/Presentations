## A Summary and Assessment of Docker Hosting and Management Options

As part of my journey with Docker, I have discovered and assessed many options for hosting, management and scaling Docker containers. I have dug beneath their collective surfaces, taken them for a test drive, pushed them to the edge, broken them, asked their staff a lot of questions and built up a good idea of which ones are worth spending your time (and maybe money) on.

In this presentation I will take a sample Docker application stack and demonstrate how Docker hosting solutions help (or hinder) the process. This will include Docker Cloud, AWS, Azure, Code Ship, Container Ship and several others.

I will cover:

- Using images from the Docker Hub and custom images
- Hosting options and portability of containers
- How Docker configuration options such as ports, entry points and commands are exposed
- Scaling containers
- Integration with Docker Toolset
- GUI and CLI options
- API availability
