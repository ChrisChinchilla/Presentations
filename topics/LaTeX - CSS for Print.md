# LaTeX - CSS for Print

## Website
Why would I want to introduce an old print technology to a CSS conference? Firstly because it's interesting to see one of the predecessors of the graphical design tools we now use so freely, but also because it's a fantastic tool for any of us needing to create multi-format projects.

In this presentation I will introduce you to the confusing, but wonderful world of LaTeX and Pandoc and how to fit them into your existing development workflows to create PDFs, ePub and image versions of your content without too much effort.

## Internal
In this presentation I will cover:

- The History of LaTeX
- What LaTeX does and how it can work with Pandoc
- LaTeX syntax
- Useful tools and plugins
- Making Pandoc and LaTeX part of existing workflows
