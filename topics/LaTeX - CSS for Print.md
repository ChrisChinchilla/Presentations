# LaTeX - CSS for Print

# Getting a 30 Year Old Technology to do things it doesn't want to

For crazy 'reasons' I decided to use LaTeX, a technology designed for academic papers, to make a board game. I want to show you why and how.

Why would I want to introduce an old print technology to modern web enthusiasts? Firstly because it's interesting to see one of the predecessors of the graphical design tools we now use so freely, but also because it's a fantastic, if inflexible tool for anyone needing to create multi-format projects.

In this presentation I will introduce you to the confusing, but wonderful world of LaTeX and how to use it to create PDFs, ePub and image versions of your content without too much effort.

In this presentation I will cover:

- The History of LaTeX
- What LaTeX does and how it can work with Pandoc
- LaTeX syntax
- Useful tools and plugins
- Making Pandoc and LaTeX part of existing workflows
