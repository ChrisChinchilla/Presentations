## The Styling behind a board game
I'm working on a board game, yes a physical printed boad game. Coming from a programming background it of course seemed obvious to me to code the content and production of the game.

I initially started using Drupal, because it was what I new best. Then I switched to Jekyll because I started a love affair with Markdown and it was the best fit moving forward.

There were two motivations behind decidinh to adopt this 'coding'  approach to building a board game. One was to allow for better collaboration, an important future aspect of the game and the other was so that I could theoretically write content once and repurpose it in multiple outputs easily.

This involves a lot of planning and thought when it comes to templating and styling. Content needs to be avaialble as a normal web page, as a print-on-demand version and as a premium print version. This has led me down a path of print styles, pandoc, latex templating and attempting to tie it all tgether.

In this presentation I would like to show some practical tools, workflows and advice for those wishing to create sites that can easily output content in multiple formats as well as even (shock, horror!) showing an audience at a CSS conference Latex templates, how they work and when/why you might want to use them.
