# Programming a board game (Lightening)
In this lightening talk I will take as few turns as possible to explain why and how I decided to program a board game. Yes, a physical, printed board game.

We will look at wondrous technologies such as Markdown, Pandoc, LaTeX and chaining them all together to create a multi-format generating workflow and (hopefully) win.

## Long Form

In this workshop I will take as few turns as possible to explain why and how I decided to program a board game. Yes, a physical, printed board game.

I will look at the theory of game design, balance and maths. I will cover the options for creating content in different formats, covering wonderful tools such as Markdown, Pandoc, LaTeX and Bash.

Taking things a step further, I'll look at mixing the worlds of programming and board games by covering build systems and testing your games as content changes.
