# Are we all doomed and what can we do about it?

As programmers, designers, writers and those who pursue 'creative' pursuits we consider ourselves mostly immune to the predicted forthcoming robot invasion of our jobs.

But should we be so confident? A recent tool released to tell you the percentage chance of robots taking your job set the percentage at 89% for technical writers. Scary news.

In this presentation I will take a forward look at the ways that our roles may change and what we can do about it, covering topics such as:

-   Automatic writing and code generation.
-   Outsourcing and undercutting.
-   The 'devaluation' of programming knowledge.
-   New Luddites and the rejection of technology.

I promise to make you smile along the way üòÅ.

## Outline

I have built this talk on my experiences attending and writing about new technologies, developments in technology. We are at a boom time, but with big changes and advancements on the horizon it's good to not be complacent, to take stock and adapt. I want to look at a handful of trends I have noticed, how they could affect our community and what we might be able to do to lessen the impact they have on us.

I also want to look at the curious irony of how some of the developments that might affect us were actually created by us, very Frankenstein.

I will spend about 5-10 minutes on each topic, plus introduction and summary.

-   Outsourcing and undercutting.
-   The 'devaluation' of programming knowledge.
-   Irrelevancy of English.
-   Developers are getting better at explaining themselves.
-   Software more user friendly.
-   New Luddites and the rejection of technology.
