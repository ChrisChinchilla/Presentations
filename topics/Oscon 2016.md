# How do we teach people to code?
Teaching people to code is fast becoming the rallying call of everyone from politicians and industry leaders to talent-deprived executives.

In this presentation I would like to draw upon my experiences in running code sprints, mentoring sessions, meetups and writing tutorials and presentations to look at how we could and should be educating the next generations of coders.

What techniques have worked for existing programs and courses, what languages are easier to teach and most importantly have the students graduating from 'learn to program' courses become valuable members of developer teams?

We will dig beneath the surface, ask some hard questions and summarize a solid set of instructions for those wanting to learn to code or educate others.

# Android Programming with Go
By Supporting GoLang on Android are Google making steps to reducing their reliance on Java and Oracle? Or is it a project just for fun? In this presentation I intend to crack open the Android robot and see what's possible by attempting to recreate tried and tested Android applications.

We will look at hardware support, app size and performance, support for Google libraries, IDE support and what is missing.

# Programming a Board Game
In this lightening talk I will take as few turns as possible to explain why and how I decided to program a board game. Yes, a physical, printed board game.

We will look at wondrous technologies such as Markdown, Pandoc, LaTeX and chaining them all together to create a multi-format generating workflow and (hopefully) win.
