# Writing Good Documentation

We spend countless hours creating technically amazing projects built upon awesome, cutting edge code. We then promote our project through newsletters, events and social media and await certain success.

But nothing happens.

Why?

Whoops, we forgot to tell anyone how to effectively use our project, all that time waisted.

In this presentation I want to draw upon my experience in writing tutorials and technical documentation to help you write clear, concise and usable documentation for your own projects.

We will cover topics such as:

- Why write documentation?
- Creating context and meaning
- Writing clear copy
- Creating meaningful examples and tutorials
- Making documentation part of build processes
