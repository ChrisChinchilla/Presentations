## Programming a board game
I'm working on a board game, yes a physical board game. Coming from a programming background it of course seemed obvious to me to code the content and production of the game.

Content needs to be available as a normal web page, a print-on-demand and as a premium print version. This led me down a path of markdown processing, print styles, pandoc, latex templating and attempting to tie it all together cohesively.

In this presentation I would like to show some practical tools, workflows and advice for those wishing to create sites that can output content in multiple formats as well as even (shock, horror!) showing an audience at a CSS conference Latex templates, how they work and when/why you might want to use them.

## Mobile Design for CSS Experts
Responsive design and mobile optimised websites have their place, but sometimes the best option for a mobile app is to go native. This can be a scary world to enter, but never fear! Both Android and iOS have mature design tools, practices and guidelines, so that even a non-coder can get involved with a native app project.

In this presentation I would like to walk through some of the common mobile CSS tools and tricks and show you might accomplish them in native mobile app design. And thus proving that you needn't be scared any longer...
