# Introducing Distributed Databases

Modern applications store a lot data and demand high availability of access to it. To cope with this increasing need, developers have long struggled with scaling, sharding and synchronizing multiple instances of traditional databases.

Enter the world of distributed databases, a model of data storage to cope with the ever changing needs of modern applications and development teams.

In this presentation we look at the principles behind distributed databases, how they function and how to design your code, applications and infrastructure to take full advantage of what they have to offer.
