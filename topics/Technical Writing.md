# Writing topics

# Test your docs

Documentation is essential for potential users to understand your awesome coding efforts.

But I know that you'd rather get back to coding as soon as possible, so how about automating as much of your documentation as possible?

In this presentation I will show you how to automate some of the repetitive tasks involved in documentation and make your colleagues jealous.

-   Testing docs
-   Spell and grammar checking
-   Generating screenshots
-   Building different versions and formats
-   Notifications
-   Generating videos

I will show you how to build workflows and plugins for several popular documentation editors and CI tools and give you more free time to watch cat videos, complain about important issues, or get replaced by a robot.

# You've Automated your Docs, Now Automate Yourself - Basic

I'm a technical writer and would rather spend time figuring out how to explain complex topics to people instead of tedious repetitive tasks.

In this presentation I will show you how to automate some of these tasks we undertake each day and make your coder colleagues jealous.

I'll start with basics like:

-   Automatically testing your API.
-   Grammar and spell checking your wonderful words.
-   Generating screenshots.
-   Building different formats of documentation.
-   Notifying stakeholders that documentation has changed.

All triggered by updates and processed by a super-slick continuous integration system.

What's next?

How about automating some of the writing you do?

-   Common words you always replace? Automate it!
-   Phrases you always delete? Automate it!
-   Short codes your documentation needs? Automate it!

I will show you how to build workflows and plugins for several popular documentation editors and give you more free time to watch cat videos, complain about coders, or get replaced by a robot.

# You've Automated your Docs, Now Automate Yourself - Advanced

Your documentation is tested, generates screenshots, builds web and PDF versions and notifies stakeholders of new versions, all triggered by updates and processed by a super-slick continuous integration system.

# Beyond Software - Learning from Other Technical Writers

Outside of my technical writing work for software projects I have been creating a board game. A board game also requires mechanics to function and players to clearly understand how these mechanics work to use and appreciate fully.

As part of my research for writing game manuals I looked at manuals for furniture, electronics, and cars to see how they explain to users how to setup and use their products.

In this presentation I will look at how the technical writing skills of different industries can learn from each other.

This will include:

-   Game Manuals and tutorials
-   Assembly instructions (e.g. those wonderful Ikea inserts)
-   Service Manuals for electronics

And as part of looking at these case studies, the presentation will cover:

-   Iconography vs Text
-   The limitations of updating print manuals
-   Reducing language and cultural colloquialisms
-   Identifying what needs to be said and what doesn't

And by the end of the presentation I hope that everyone will have learnt a lot from each other and realise that we're all trying to achieve the same thing(s).

# Writing Good Documentation - Shortform

We spend countless hours creating technically amazing projects built upon awesome, cutting edge code. We then promote our project through newsletters, events and social media and await certain success.

But nothing happens.

Why?

Whoops, we forgot to tell anyone how to effectively use our project, all that time wasted.

In this presentation I want to draw upon my experience in writing tutorials and technical documentation to help you write clear, concise and usable documentation for your own projects.

We will cover topics such as:

-   Why write documentation?
-   Creating context and meaning
-   Writing clear copy
-   Creating meaningful examples and tutorials
-   Making documentation part of build processes

## Writing Good Documentation - Longform

We spend countless hours creating technically amazing projects built upon awesome, cutting edge code. We then promote our project through newsletters, events and social media and await certain success.

But nothing happens.

Why?

Whoops, we forgot to tell anyone how to effectively use our project, all that time wasted.

In this presentation I want to draw upon my experience in writing tutorials and technical documentation to help you write clear, concise and usable documentation for your own projects.

We will cover topics such as:

-   Why write documentation?
-   Creating context and meaning
-   Writing clear copy
-   Creating meaningful examples and tutorials
-   Markdown, Restructured Text, Pandoc, LaTeX
-   Making documentation part of build processes
-   Testing Docs
-   Versioning of Docs and maintaining consistency

## Explain Yourself! Documentation for Better Code

How many times have you come across an awesome looking library or tool that you're keen to work with in your own project but can't even begin to understand how to use it?

Programmers are great at creating amazing and cutting-edge code, but not always so good and explaining themselves, and I want to help.

In this presentation I want to draw upon my experience in writing tutorials and technical documentation to help you write clear, concise and usable documentation for your own projects.

We will cover topics such as:

-   Why write documentation?
-   Explaining your point and motivation
-   Creating context and meaning
-   Writing clear copy
-   Creating meaningful examples and tutorials
-   Documentation systems and formats
-   Making documentation part of build processes
-   Testing Docs
-   Versioning of Docs and maintaining consistency

## Don't repeat yourself

## A crash course in developers for documentarians

For the past six months, I've been delivering a presentation at technical conferences giving developers a 30-minute tour of quick tips to improve their writing. The talk has gone well, and I hope I've managed to convince a few that well-crafted words to describe their efforts are not as hard or as tedious as they think.

But how well do you really know developers and how they think? Some of us come from developer backgrounds (but a long time ago) whilst others of us don't and our more technical colleagues remain mostly a mystery.

In this presentation, I intend to give you a crash course in understanding developers, their motivations, desires, tool chains and jargon. Then the next time you are ushered into a darkened room to try and interpret a stream of words aimed in your direction, maybe you'll not only be able to understand them, but you'll surprise everyone with a witty and appropriate response.

Oh, and thus make your writing and explanations better of course.

# Automated housework

I get it, as developers you don't like writing documentation, as someone once described it to me, it's like 'housework', something you know you should do, but don't really want to. In this presentation I will help you make the job easier and more enjoyable by showing you how to automate as much of the process as possible.

I'll start with basics like:

-   Generating (some) documentation from your code.
-   Automatically testing your API.
-   Grammar and spell checking your wonderful words.
-   Generating screenshots.
-   Building different formats of documentation.

All triggered by updates and processed by a super-slick continuous integration system.

What's next?

How about automating some of the writing you do?

-   Common words you always replace? Automate it!
-   Phrases you always delete? Automate it!
-   Short codes your documentation needs? Automate it!

I will show you how to build workflows and plugins for several popular documentation editors and give you more free time to watch cat videos, complain about writers, or get replaced by a robot.

## Outline

This is a packed talk. I discuss each topic for about 3-5 minutes and then show code/practical examples.

# Documentation beyond words

In this presentation I will explore other ways to communicate concepts beyond words to show that documentation needn't just be about technical writing.

In the first part of the presentation I will briefly cover theories and principles behind forms of communication and what documentarians can learn from them. Topics such as:

-   **Portraying meaning in images**: Iconography, maps, manuals
-   **Non-verbal conversation**: Body language, ways of speaking
-   **Fidelity**: Sketch notes, simplicity, style

During each of these topics I will present in the style of the topic, so expect something a little different.

In the second practical part of the presentation I will take elements of the theory and applying them practically. I will start by looking at screenshots and diagrams. When and how to use them, what they should show, and how to manage them.

Then I'll cover taking screenshots to the next level with animated gifs and screen recordings that show clear user flows and expected results.

Finally in this part of the presentation I will cover interactive documentation, and the options for allowing readers to directly manipulate and experiment with documentation and directly see inputs and outputs.

In summary, our work typically appears on one of the most dynamic platforms (the web) that has ever existed, let's all do more with it!
