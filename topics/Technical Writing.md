## You've Automated your Docs, Now Automate Yourself

Your documentation is tested, generates screenshots, builds web and PDF versions and notifies stakeholders of new versions, all triggered by updates and processed by a super-slick continuous integration system.

What's next?

How about automating some of the writing you do?

In this presentation I will show you how to automate some of the repetitive tasks we undertake each day and make your coder colleagues jealous.

- Common words you always replace? Automate it!
- Phrases you always delete? Automate it!
- Short codes your documentation needs? Automate it!

I will show you how to build workflows and plugins for several popular documentation editors and give you more free time to watch cat videos, complain about coders, or get replaced by a robot.

## Beyond Software - Learning from Other Technical Writers

Outside of my technical writing work for software projects I have been creating a board game. A board game also requires mechanics to function and players to clearly understand how these mechanics work to use and appreciate fully.

As part of my research for writing game manuals I looked at manuals for furniture, electronics, and cars to see how they explain to users how to setup and use their products.

In this presentation I will look at how the technical writing skills of different industries can learn from each other.

This will include:

- Game Manuals and tutorials
- Assembly instructions (e.g. those wonderful Ikea inserts)
- Service Manuals for electronics

And as part of looking at these case studies, the presentation will cover:

- Iconography vs Text
- The limitations of updating print manuals
- Reducing language and cultural colloquialisms
- Identifying what needs to be said and what doesn't

And by the end of the presentation I hope that everyone will have learnt a lot from each other and realize that we're all trying to achieve the same thing(s).

## Writing Good Documentation - Shortform

We spend countless hours creating technically amazing projects built upon awesome, cutting edge code. We then promote our project through newsletters, events and social media and await certain success.

But nothing happens.

Why?

Whoops, we forgot to tell anyone how to effectively use our project, all that time waisted.

In this presentation I want to draw upon my experience in writing tutorials and technical documentation to help you write clear, concise and usable documentation for your own projects.

We will cover topics such as:

- Why write documentation?
- Creating context and meaning
- Writing clear copy
- Creating meaningful examples and tutorials
- Making documentation part of build processes

### Writing Good Documentation - Longform

We spend countless hours creating technically amazing projects built upon awesome, cutting edge code. We then promote our project through newsletters, events and social media and await certain success.

But nothing happens.

Why?

Whoops, we forgot to tell anyone how to effectively use our project, all that time waisted.

In this presentation I want to draw upon my experience in writing tutorials and technical documentation to help you write clear, concise and usable documentation for your own projects.

We will cover topics such as:

- Why write documentation?
- Creating context and meaning
- Writing clear copy
- Creating meaningful examples and tutorials
- Markdown, Restructured Text, Pandoc, LaTeX
- Making documentation part of build processes
- Testing Docs
- Versioning of Docs and maintaining consistency

### Explain Yourself! Documentation for Better Code

How many times have you come across an awesome looking library or tool that you're keen to work with in your own project but can't even begin to understand how to use it?

Programmers are great at creating amazing and cutting-edge code, but not always so good and explaining themselves, and I want to help.

In this presentation I want to draw upon my experience in writing tutorials and technical documentation to help you write clear, concise and usable documentation for your own projects.

We will cover topics such as:

- Why write documentation?
- Explaining your point and motivation
- Creating context and meaning
- Writing clear copy
- Creating meaningful examples and tutorials
- Documentation systems and formats
- Making documentation part of build processes
- Testing Docs
- Versioning of Docs and maintaining consistency
