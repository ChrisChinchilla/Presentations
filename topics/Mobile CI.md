# Continuous Integration Options for Android

As developers we all know that Continuous Integration (CI) is a fantastic way of keeping our code and apps the best they can be whilst reducing extra developer overhead.

CI for mobile apps and projects requires extra planning and steps and in this presentation I would like to look at how to assemble the best build systems, CI systems and test systems for creating a seamless Android development workflow.

This will include:

- Weighing up commercial and open source options available
- Plugging into other 3rd party systems that may be useful to your build processes
- Pitfalls, problems and 'gotchas' of mobile CI

And much more.
