# Advocate Bits
_EnthusiastiCon, Berlin_


## You have made something awesome
### You think it is anyway
### You want developers to use it
### It probably makes less sense than you think
### There's a lot of 'competition'
### That's where I come in


## What do we do?
### Somewhere between tech and marketing
### Talking
### Helping
### Being nice to people
### Partnerships
Note: I am a 'Developer Advocate', sitting somewhere between development and marketing. Or, to be blunt, we are nerds who are good at talking to people.

It's our job to explain our software offerings to potential developers without diluting the message or 'dumbing it down'. This is harder than it sounds, but the job involves traveling a lot and meeting lots of people who are working on awesome things, so that helps.

Examples.


## Why do I love it?
### Travel
### Hearing great ideas


## Want to get involved?
### You don't need to know everything
### New role in EU
### Confidence
### Manners


## Thanks

Chris Ward
